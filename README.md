# DB Excel Data Manager
DB Excel Data Manager is built using Microsoft Excel and allows data from database tables to be viewed, added and edited using 
Excel Worksheets. Database table schema details can also be viewed. 

DB Excel Data Manager is distributed in the hope that it will be useful for assisting with database systems administration and 
legacy application automation (e.g., for regression testing).
